\begin{problem}[Putnam 2009 - A1]
Let $f$ be a real-valued function on the plane such that for every square $ABCD$ in the plane, $f(A) + f(B) + f(C) + f(D) = 0$. Does it follow that $f(P) = 0$ for all points in the plane?
\end{problem}

The answer is yes. To see this, let $(x, y)$ be an arbitrary point in the plane. Then, we have 
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) + f(x+1, y) + f(x, y+1) + f(x+1, y+1) &= 0
\\
f(x, y) + f(x-1, y) + f(x-1, y+1) + f(x, y+1) &= 0
\\
f(x, y) + f(x-1, y) + f(x-1, y-1) + f(x, y-1) &= 0
\\
f(x, y) + f(x+1, y) + f(x+1, y-1) + f(x, y-1) &= 0
\\
- \left[ f(x-1, y-1) + f(x+1, y+1) + f(x+1, y-1) + f(x-1, y-1) \right] = -(0) &= 0
\\
-2 \left[ f(x, y+1) + f(x+1, y) + f(x, y-1) + f(x-1, y) \right] = -2(0) &= 0.
\end{align*}
Adding the equations and simplifying, we get $$4f(x, y) = 0,$$
which means
$$f(x, y) = 0.$$
